## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a security researcher specializing in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and exploit development using industry-standard tools like Kali Linux and the Metasploit Framework. This repository is a curated collection of scripts, modules, and walkthroughs designed to support ethical hacking, system auditing, and secure software development practices.

My work focuses on identifying and demonstrating real-world security flaws, simulating attacks in controlled environments, and helping organizations improve their defenses through system hardening and proactive remediation. Whether targeting misconfigured services, outdated software, or weak authentication mechanisms, every project here is rooted in responsible disclosure and legal penetration testing practices.

Exploit Development: You'll find custom Metasploit modules and proof-of-concept scripts crafted to highlight specific vulnerabilities. These examples include buffer overflows, misused APIs, privilege escalation techniques, and evasion strategiesâ€”all designed to improve understanding of offensive security in a lab environment.

System Hardening: Testing is only half the equation. This repository also covers defensive techniques such as secure configuration baselines, access control policies, service minimization, and patch management strategies to reduce an organizationâ€™s attack surface.

Ethical Hacking Practices: Each project is built with ethical guidelines in mind. Labs are tested on isolated virtual machines or cloud sandboxes, with clear documentation, impact analysis, and mitigation suggestions to promote learning and responsible use.

This repository is ideal for ethical hackers, red teamers, system administrators, and security enthusiasts looking to deepen their knowledge of offensive and defensive cybersecurity. Setup guides, tool usage tips, and real-world case studies are included for hands-on experience.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”ethical hacking is about continuous learning, and your insights are always welcome.
